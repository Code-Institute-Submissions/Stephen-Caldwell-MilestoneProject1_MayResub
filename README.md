## User Stories
I chose to update the website for my father's plumbing shop as my first Milestone Project. The current site is very outdated and needed a good bit of updating, it's very busy and isn't user friendly. I wanted to make the site more simple and easy to use. I also felt like it was a good way for me to build my confidence back up, having failed my college degree.
### Home Page
The home page is an easy to use and understanble design for the user. There is simple navigation at the top of the page for the user to get to the different sections of the site.
The images on the home page were taken directly form the orignal site with permission. There is also the special offer on the home page which allows the user to click on the card opening up a modal displaying more information.
See navigation & hero img.PNG, Special offers.PNG, and Special offer modal.PNG in https://github.com/Stephen-Caldwell/MilestoneProject1/tree/master/Screenshots/

### About us page
The about us page gives the user a background into the business and the staff who work there, outlining experience and what is provided.
There is an image gallery to show examples of what the user could have. There is also a list of some of the brands that are carried at the shop most of which are well known and trusted brands.
See about us paragraph.PNG, brand list.PNG, and product gallery.PNG in https://github.com/Stephen-Caldwell/MilestoneProject1/tree/master/Screenshots/

### Product Page
The product page gives the user an example of the types of products that the shop provides, displayed in a clear concise way.
See product cards in https://github.com/Stephen-Caldwell/MilestoneProject1/tree/master/Screenshots/

### Contact us page
The contact us page gives the user a way to email the shop with any queries they have it also gives the address as well as an embedded Google map to show exactly where the shop is as well as directions in Google maps when the link is clicked.

## Wireframes
The wireframes were completed using Balsamiq, the orignal mockups were loosley followed and as the design shanged I changed the wireframes to be more accurate.

## Deployment
The site is deloyed on https://stephen-caldwell.github.io/MilestoneProject1/. To deploy the site I used GitHub pages.
